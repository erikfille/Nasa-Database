      "The laws of physics may say it's near impossible to fly on Mars, but actually flying a heavier-than-air vehicle on the Red Planet is much harder than that. NASA’s Mars 2020 mission will deliver a technology demonstration that will put the idea to the test -- a helicopter that will perform controlled flight on Mars.

    title: "Mars Sample Return Media Reel",
    description:
      "Compilation of b-roll for media. Collecting samples from Mars and bringing them back to Earth will be a historic undertaking that starts with the launch of NASA's Perseverance rover, part of the Mars 2020 mission. Perseverance will collect samples and leave them on Mars for a future mission to retrieve and return to Earth. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are solidifying concepts for this Mars sample return campaign. The current concept includes a lander, a fetch rover, an ascent vehicle to launch the sample container to Martian orbit, and a retrieval spacecraft with a payload for capturing and containing the samples and then sending them back to Earth.

      "2015 marks 50 years of successful NASA missions to Mars starting with Mariner 4 in 1965. Since then, a total of 15 robotic missions led by various NASA centers have laid the groundwork for future human missions to the Red Planet. The journey to Mars continues with additional robotic missions planned for 2016 and 2020, and human missions in the 2030s.",

      "In January 2019, NASA's Mars Helicopter technology demonstration was put through  rigorous tests to verify it is ready for the Red Planet. While flying helicopters is  commonplace here on Earth, flying one, hundreds of millions of miles (kilometers)  away in the thin Martian atmosphere, is something else entirely. The team recreated  the gravity and flying conditions at Mars in JPL's Space Simulator, a 25-foot wide  vacuum chamber. The helicopter hovered 2 inches (its target height) to fulfill its flight  readiness requirement for Mars.  The Mars Helicopter is scheduled to launch with the agency’s Mars 2020 rover mission  in July 2020 to demonstrate the viability and potential of heavier-than-air vehicles on  the Red Planet.",

      "Perseverance Rover’s Descent and Touchdown on Mars: Onboard Camera Views",
    description:
      "NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance mission captured thrilling footage of its rover landing in Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.  The real footage in this video was captured by several cameras that are part of the rover's entry, descent, and landing suite. The views include a camera looking down from the spacecraft's descent stage (a kind of rocket-powered jet pack that helps fly the rover to its landing site), a camera on the rover looking up at the descent stage, a camera on the top of the aeroshell (a capsule protecting the rover) looking up at that parachute, and a camera on the bottom of the rover looking down at the Martian surface.  The audio embedded in the video comes from the mission control call-outs during entry, descent, and landing.   For more information about Perseverance, visit https://mars.nasa.gov/perseverance  Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech",
